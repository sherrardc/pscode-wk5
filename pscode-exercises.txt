// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

m = (4+4)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

start
Integer number,S
Input Number
S=Number%2
if (S==0)
output "Even"
else
output "Odd"
end if 
stop

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.

"please enter 5 numbers"
Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5

"the average is"
Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
Write avg

If (n1 < n2)
Set max to n2
else
Set max to n1
If (n3 > max)
Set max to n3
If(n4 > mx)
Set max to n4
If(n5 > max)
Set mx to n5
"The max is"
max

If(n1 >n2)
Set min to n2
else
Set min to n1
If(n3 < min)
Set min to n3
If(n4 < min)
Set min to n4
If(n5 < min)
Set min to n5
"the min is"
min
